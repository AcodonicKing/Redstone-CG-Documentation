            <h2>Immediate Instructions</h2>
            <p>If you’ve just loaded your world from older version to version 0.2.0 and things look very wrong—don’t panic! Follow these steps exactly:</p>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong>Backup Your World!</strong><br> <em>If you haven’t opened the world in 0.2.0 or later yet</em>, make a backup or duplicate your world folder. Then, load it in version <strong>0.2.1</strong>.<br> <em>If you already did</em>, and don’t have a backup, then still make a backup. At this stage, loading the world in older version will not fix your world.<br> <em>If you are updating from version before 0.1.1</em>, then it's recommended to update to version 0.1.1 first and then start over from this step.</li>
                <li> <strong>Enable Cheats (Singleplayer Only):</strong><br> If cheats are disabled, pause the game, click <em>“Open to LAN”</em>, enable cheats, and click <em>“Start LAN World”</em>. This will allow you to use the repair commands. </li>
                <li> <strong>Prevent Block Breaking:</strong><br> Run:<br> <code>/redstonecg_repair canSurviveAir true</code><br> This keeps RedstoneCG blocks from falling or breaking while suspended. </li>
                <li> <strong>Fix Block Orientation:</strong><br> Press <kbd>F3 + G</kbd> to display chunk borders.<br> Then, for every chunk containing RedstoneCG blocks (visit each chunk only once), run:<br> <code>/redstonecg_repair flooring chunk</code><br> This sets all gates and wires to face the floor. </li>
                <li> <strong>Fix RedCu Wire Shape:</strong><br> Again, for each relevant chunk (without repeating any), run:<br> <code>/redstonecg_repair old chunk</code><br> This adjusts RedCu Wire visuals and behavior to the ones in the old version. </li>
                <li> <strong>Re-enable Normal Physics:</strong><br> Run:<br> <code>/redstonecg_repair canSurviveAir false</code><br> This sets blocks back to their normal survival-mode behavior. </li>
                <li> <strong>Kickstart Your Circuits:</strong><br> Most circuits will now look correct, but they may not work yet.<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Manually re-enter values into any <a href="Analog/Analog_Source.html">Analog Source</a>.</li>
                        <li>Find a gate connected to Redstone Dust, and activate the dust to send a signal pulse. This should get everything running again.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>If you are updating from 0.2.0. to 0.2.1. then on every <a href="/Redstone-CG-Documentation/Wires/Redstone_to_RedCu_Converter.html">Redstone to RedCu Converter</a> execute <code>/redstonecg_repair old &lt;position of the block&gt;</code> without executing this command twice on the same block.</p>

            <h2>Reasons</h2>
            <h3>What happened?</h3>
            <p>When updating to version <strong>0.2.0</strong>, you may have noticed all of your RedstoneCG blocks are rotated incorrectly or no longer behave as they should. This is due to a fundamental change in how gates determine their placement orientation.</p>
            <p>Previously, the mod used a property called <code>facing</code> to define the direction a gate was looking. Starting from <strong>0.2.0</strong>, this same property is now used to define which <em>face</em> of the block the gate is placed on—allowing support for <strong>walls and ceilings</strong>.</p>
            <p>Some Block State properties were also moved to Block Entity, which most blocks didn't have.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this change broke backward compatibility with old saves.</p>
            <h3>Why Didn’t the Mod Fix This Automatically?</h3>
            <p>Although RedstoneCG can rename or replace blocks in the registry easily, it has very limited access to world save data. That means detecting how a gate was originally placed or rewriting blockstates across chunks is not feasible from within the mod itself.</p>
            <p>Because of these constraints, manual repair commands are required.</p>
            <h3>Will This Happen Again?</h3>
            <p>Possibly. RedstoneCG is still in its <strong>Beta</strong> phase, where major structural and data changes may occur. Every effort is made to maintain compatibility, but drastic changes—especially those enabling new features—may require manual world repair in the future.</p>
