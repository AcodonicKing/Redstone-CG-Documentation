                <strong>Description:</strong> Schrödinger's Redstone is a partially visual, partially mod mechanical bug observed when a line (column) of <a href="../../Parallel_Gates.html">Parallel Gates</a> is constructed. Measuring the output of any row causes the output signal to change its value by a difference of one, giving the impression that the redstone exists in two states simultaneously. This is often followed by the related bug, <a href="../RCGB-2/page.html">Row Ghosting</a>. During testing, both the output and the row of <a href="../../Parallel_Gates.html">Parallel Gates</a> appeared to blink rapidly and inconsistently, despite no timing circuit being involved. The effect ceased immediately when the output was no longer measured.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cause:</strong> Changing default values in <code>net.mcreator.redstonecg.procedures.GetParalelGateSignalProcedure.java</code> from 0 to -1 activates both this bug and <a href="../RCGB-2/page.html">Row Ghosting</a>. Comments in the code identify problematic locations. This issue stems from MCreator's default behavior of returning "-1" in scenarios where a signal cannot be reliably read. The interaction between Parallel Gate outputs and input logic under these conditions results in unstable signal states.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Consequences:</strong> This bug introduces both visual and mechanical inconsistencies. While gameplay impact is minimal, the behavior highlights potential vulnerabilities in Parallel Gate logic, particularly in how signal reliability is handled.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Safe Configurations:</strong> No safe configurations have been identified. The exact triggers for this bug remain unclear, necessitating further investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Special Notes:</strong> This bug is classified as "Assumed Inactive" due to unresolved uncertainties about its exact triggers and execution paths. While changing the default return value from "-1" to "0" has mitigated the issue, similar conditions may reintroduce it. Additionally, there are other MCreator-generated files retaining default behaviors that do not exhibit this issue, suggesting potential interactions or overlooked factors.

                During testing, a collaborator known as CaptainOverkill humorously referred to this behavior as a feature rather than a bug, likening it to a unique game mechanic. While this was intended as a joke, the developer found the visual and mechanical effect fascinating and is considering incorporating a controlled version of this phenomenon as a future gameplay element. CaptainOverkill has also expressed a strong desire for the effect to remain in some form.
